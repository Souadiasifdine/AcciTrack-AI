Accidents can occur unexpectedly, and responding to them quickly is essential to saving lives. By leveraging **Google Maps Platform**, **AcciTrack AI** aims to provide faster detection and more efficient emergency response systems. The project enables authorities and emergency responders to act swiftly, using real-time **location tracking** and **traffic analysis** data.

## Key Features

1. **Real-Time Accident Detection**  
   Using **Google Maps Traffic API**, the system monitors traffic patterns and detects anomalies that may indicate accidents or traffic congestion. Once an accident is detected, the system can instantly send **location details** to emergency services, ensuring a quick response.

2. **Location Tracking with GPS**  
   The system integrates a **GPS module** (NEO6M) to track the exact location of accidents. This allows for accurate **geospatial tracking** and precise reporting of the accidentâ€™s location, which is vital for emergency responders.

3. **Traffic Analysis**  
   Leveraging **Google Maps Traffic API**, **AcciTrack AI** continuously analyzes real-time traffic data to identify areas of congestion or incidents. This data helps to predict traffic conditions and enables **alternative route suggestions** to avoid accident sites.

4. **Alternative Route Suggestions**  
   By analyzing real-time traffic information and accident data, the system can suggest alternative routes for drivers to avoid accidents or delays. This is critical in improving the flow of traffic and reducing the impact of accidents on other road users.

## Technologies Used

1. **Google Maps Platform (Maps API, Traffic API, Directions API)**  
   - The **Google Maps Platform** powers the project, enabling **real-time traffic analysis** and providing **location tracking** and **route optimization**. These APIs help to monitor and analyze traffic conditions, offering a seamless experience for detecting and avoiding accidents.

2. **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**  
   - AI is used to analyze traffic patterns and detect anomalies that may signify accidents. It uses data from Google Maps API, combined with sensor inputs, to accurately assess traffic conditions and predict possible accident scenarios.

3. **ESP32 with SIM800L**  
   - The **ESP32** development board, equipped with a **SIM800L GSM/GPRS module**, is used for communication. This module ensures that accident alerts and location details can be sent via **SMS** or **phone calls** to emergency services, ensuring swift action.

## How the System Works

1. **Data Collection**  
   The system collects data from the **MPU6050 sensor** (for detecting movement) and **GPS module** (for tracking the location). Additionally, the **Google Maps Traffic API** is used to gather real-time traffic information and detect anomalies.

2. **Accident Detection**  
   The system continuously monitors traffic conditions using **Google Maps APIs**. When the system detects a sudden change in traffic flow or an unusual movement, it triggers the accident detection process. The **MPU6050 sensor** helps confirm if the detected anomaly is indeed an accident by analyzing acceleration and rotational changes.

3. **Location Reporting**  
   Upon detecting an accident, the **GPS module** provides the exact location coordinates, which are then sent to emergency services via **SMS** using the **SIM800L module**. This ensures a rapid response and accurate dispatch of emergency personnel to the accident site.

4. **Real-Time Updates and Alternative Routes**  
   The system continuously provides **real-time traffic updates** using **Google Maps APIs**, allowing it to suggest alternative routes for drivers to avoid accidents. This helps minimize traffic disruptions and optimize driving conditions in the affected areas.

## Software Used

1. **Google Maps Platform**  
   - Used for integrating **Maps API**, **Traffic API**, and **Directions API** to track accidents, provide live traffic updates, and suggest alternate routes.
